abstract={Experimental equipment was developed in order to measure easily the shear strength of adhesive layers subjected to impact loads. The stress state of an adhesive joint was calculated with the finite element method (FEM). The results calculated from the FEM were compared with those from experiments conducted with the equipment. It was shown that the fracture behaviour of the joint depended on the level of the incident stress wave. When loading a comparatively high incident stress, the adhesive layer fractures mainly with the shear stress. It is considered that the maximum shear stress measured is the shear strength under impact loads. In order to confirm the validity of this evaluation method, the maximum shear stress was compared with the impact shear strength, which was measured using a cylindrical butt joint subjected to impact torsional loads. Both values accorded well. From this we were able to conclude that the shear strength of the adhesive layer subjected to impact loads could be evaluated with this equipment.  2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In automotive construction, adhesive bonding can be used for joining metals, plastics or combinations of the two, and it offers the further advantage that, because the joints are continuous, an overall increase in body stiffness is achieved, thus enabling thinner material to be used. Because of their ability to absorb energy adhesive joints can also contribute to the impacted system. The objective of this work is to investigate the behavior of a flexible adhesive under impact loading using the single lap joint configuration. This adhesive showed a high strain to failure with good strength. These features of the adhesive under impact loading improve structural crashworthiness. Results showed that the lap joint strength increases considerably under impact loading compared with those under quasi-static loading and that there is a relationship between the joint performance and the loading speeds.},

abstract={The stress wave propagations and interface stress distributions in the single-lap adhesive joint under impact tensile loads are analyzed using the three-dimensional finite element method (3D-FEM) taking into account the strain rate sensitive of the adhesive using CowperSymonds constitutive model. It is found that the rupture of the joint initiates near the middle area of the edges of the interfaces along the width direction. In addition, the effects of Youngs modulus of the adherend, the overlap length and the thickness of the adhesive layer, and the initial impact velocity of the impacted mass on the stress wave propagations and the interface stress distributions are examined. The characteristics are compared with those of the joint under static loads, which show the different properties. Furthermore, experiments are also carried out for measuring the strain responses and the joint strength. A fairly good agreement is observed between the numerical and the measured results. The strength of the single-lap adhesive joint, which is described using impact energy, is obtained between 5.439 and 5.620 J for the present joint.  2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Plastic deformation of structures absorbs substantial kinetic energy when impact occurs. For this reason, energy-absorbing components have been extensively used in the structural design of vehicles to intentionally absorb a large portion of crash energy to reduce the severe injury of occupants. On the other hand, high peak crushing force may to a certain extent indicate the risk of structural integrity and biomechanical damage of occupants. For this reason, it is of great significance to maximize the energy absorption and minimize the peak force by seeking for optimal design of these components. This paper aims to design the multi-cell cross-sectional thin-walled columns with these two crashworthiness criteria. An explicit finite element analysis (FEA) is used to derive higher-order response surfaces for these two objectives. Both the single-objective and multi-objective optimizations are performed for the single, double, triple and quadruple cell sectional columns under longitudinal impact loading. A comparative analysis is consequently given to explore the relationship between these two design criteria with the different optimization formulations.  2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, the energy dissipation during the normal impact of an elastic spherical particle with a substrate, which is assumed to be elastic or elastic-plastic, is investigated using the finite element method (FEM). For the elastic impact, the effect of the size of the substrate (which is assumed to be homogeneous) on the impact behaviour is investigated. By changing the substrate size, the number of reflections of stress wave propagation within the contact duration altered. It is found that the energy dissipation due to stress wave propagation is negligible (<1\% of the total kinetic energy) if there is more than one reflection during the contact. If there is no reflection at all within the contact duration, a significant amount of kinetic energy is dissipated due to stress wave propagation. The energy loss ratio λ (the ratio of kinetic energy dissipated to the initial total kinetic energy) is proportional to the impact velocity Vi with a power law of 3/5, which is consistent with the analysis of Hunter [Hunter SC. J Mech Phys Solids 1957;8:162-71]. For the plastic impact, the energy loss due to stress wave propagation becomes negligible and kinetic energy is mainly dissipated due to plastic deformation. Two distinct regimes of plastic impacts are distinguished by a critical impact velocity, Vi* [Wu CY, Li LY, Thornton C. Int J Impact Eng 2003;28:929-46]: elastoplastic impact and finite-plastic-deformation impact. The kinetic energy dissipation behaviour for these two regimes is discussed. It is shown that a sharper decrease of the coefficient of restitution with an increasing normalised impact velocity Vi/Vy (Vy is the yield velocity) is observed for finite-plastic-deformation impacts than for elastoplastic impacts.  2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The propagation of stress waves and the concentration of dynamic stress under impact loading in single lap joints, tapered lap joints and scarf joints, which were bonded adhesively, were investigated analytically and experimentally. Viscoelastic properties of cured adhesive resin were obtained from the variation of strain waves which propagated in a rod of cured resin. The compliance of the cured adhesive resin depended on the frequency of the strain waves. The viscoelastic properties obtained in the test were formulated by Voigt viscoelastic models. The stress distribution and the time variation of stress and strain in the joints under tensile impact loading were calculated using the finite element method, considering the viscoelastic properties of the adhesive. Stress concentration occurred in both the edges of the adhesive layers of the single lap joints and the tapered lap joints. The stress concentration in the scarf joints was relatively small. The stress occurred in the taper lap joints was smaller than that in the single lap joints when the taper lap joints had enough taper length. Impact test on the joints, which had adherends of aluminum alloy, was conducted to verify the pertinence of the analyses. The deformation of the tapered lap joints and the scarf joints showed good agreement on the analytical results. The deformation of the single lap joints was more complicated than the analytical results.},

abstract={Lap joints are used extensively in the manufacture of cars. In order to determine the effect of using a structural adhesive instead of spot-welding, a detailed series of tests and finite element analyses were conducted using a range of loadings. The adhesive was a toughened epoxy and the adherend was mild steel typical of that used in the manufacture of car bodyshells. The lap joints were tested in tension (which creates shear across the bondline), four-point loading (pure bending) and three-point loading (bending plus shear). Various parameters were investigated such as the overlap length, the bondline thickness and the spew fillet. The major finding is that three-point bending and tension loading are very similar in the way in which they affect the adhesive while the four-point bend test does not cause failure because the steel yields before the joint fails. A failure criterion has been proposed based on the tensile load and bending moment applied to the joint.  2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper reports the results of an experimental study on bonded joints, carried out by means of an instrumented impact pendulum, equipped to load overlap specimens in shear. Such testing configuration is the most adequate and natural to study the possible modifications of the behavior of the joint, changing from static to dynamic loading condition, keeping the same specimen type. The specimens were steel strips bonded by an epoxy adhesive (Hysol 3425). Several values of lap length, adhesive and adherends thickness were adopted, to achieve rupture under different peel and shear stress combinations. The stress state at rupture has been calculated by means of a structural solution. The results show that the failure points, in a chart having as axes the maximum values of peel and shear structural stress, lie outside the rectangular limit zone previously obtained under static conditions. Therefore, in spite of the concerns associated with the impact condition, the strength of the tested adhesive does not decrease with respect to the case of static loading. In alternative, also the evaluation of the stress intensity factor proves to be effective to predict failure in the considered cases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The design of vehicle front structures for crashworthiness is nowadays commonly based on a series of rigid subsystems that constitute a nearly undeformable survival cell for the passengers, and deformable subsystems able to efficiently dissipate the vehicle kinetic energy. During frontal crash, which is by far the most dangerous impact situation, the front rails represent the main deformable components aimed to dissipate the kinetic energy of the vehicle, therefore their behaviour is crucial to obtain good vehicle performance, with stable and controlled energy dissipation. The design of the front rail, usually consisting of a thin-walled prismatic column, requires definition of the geometry, that is, of the shape and dimensions of the cross section, of the thickness of the material, and of the material itself. The results of an experimental programme aimed to study the progressive collapse behaviour of some thin-walled closed-section structural sections made from deep-drawing steels and joined with different joining systems are reported. Solutions characterized by different continuous joining technologies, non-conventional for automotive constructions, are examined and compared to the usual spot-welding solution. Different types of adhesives (acrylic and epoxy) and laser-welding are considered. Furthermore, since the collapse is influenced by the loading rate and the materials used in this application are known to be strain-rate sensitive, static and impact loading conditions were examined. The obtained results demonstrate that continuously joined structures are at least equivalent to and generally better than spot-welded structures, and have further advantages typical of these joining solutions (higher stiffness and fatigue strength, improved vibration response, especially in the case of adhesive joints). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper aims to investigate the crashworthiness of adhesively bonded joints for composite panels under transverse (off-plane) loading. The adherends were made of plain weave carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) composites; and epoxy adhesive Hysol 9432 was used for bonding. The three point bending tests were conducted first to examine the influence of overlap geometrical parameters, and the impact tests were then carried out to explore the damage process under different impact energies. The results show that the ultimate load and stiffness increase with the increasing overlap width and length in the three point bending tests, and the influence caused by overlap width is more significant. The energy absorption and crack length increase as the impact energy increases in the low velocity impact tests. It is found that for the joint with 20. mm overlap width and 30. mm overlap length, the ultimate load and absorbed energy are 725. N and 4.03. J respectively under the dynamic transverse impact respectively, which are 1.57 times and 1.07 times higher than those under the static transverse bending. By observing micrographs of the failure surface of the specimens tested, the failure mode of CFRP adhesively bonded joints was mixing cohesive and adhesive fracture. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Adhesive bonding is increasingly being used in structural applications such as in automotive joints. The theoretical analyses and experimental data are generally for rigid and strong epoxy adhesives. Elastomeric adhesives such as polyurethanes are used in structural applications such as windshield bonding because they present important advantages in terms of damping, impact, fatigue, and safety which are critical factors in the automotive industry. However, there are other structural applications in the main body where polyurethanes may also be used. The main objective of the present project is to compare the behaviour of structural joints used in the automotive industry, such as single lap joints and T-joints made of rigid adhesives, and those made of elastic adhesives in terms of stiffness, strength, impact, damping, and fatigue. The elastomeric adhesive selected was a polyurethane from Sika (Sikaflex 256) and the structural adhesive selected was an epoxy from Huntsman (Araldite AV138/HV998). The shear strength of the polyurethane is approximately four times lower than that of the epoxy. However, the polyurethane shear failure strain is 330%, whereas that of the epoxy is only 6%. The benefits of using elastomeric adhesives in structural adhesive joints used in the automotive industry are described, especially in terms of ductility, impact, and fatigue.

The material model parameters required for both approaches are determined by a comprehensive set of experiments, including quasi-static and dynamic adhesive coupon testing, fracture toughness testing, and quasi-static tension/shear (and combined) testing of thin adhesive layers. A more complex adhesively joined assembly of two aluminium extrusions subjected to quasi-static (QS) and dynamic loading serves as the final validation example for both modelling approaches.

Elastic behavior was assumed for both adhesive and adherends. Average shear stress and stress homogeneity were extracted and compared. It was observed that the adhesive shear stiffness increases the average shear stress. Moreover, it makes the stress heterogeneity more important. On the other hand, higher values of the substrates longitudinal stiffness make the average shear stress higher; whereas, the stress homogeneity in the joint is better achieved for lower substrates' shear stiffness. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The use of adhesives as a bonding system in aircraft construction has increased because of its structural efficiency, simplicity and lightness. New aircrafts are designed taking into account, among other criteria, security standards in case of crash or fall. For an aircraft, security techniques in case of collision can be defined as the internal system capability to prevent the passengers from being injured in an impact. A proactive proposal is to mitigate the impact energy absorbed by the passengers, by means of increasing as much as possible the capacity of the aircraft to capture energy. In this work, we suggest taking advantage of the energy that could be dissipated by the structural bonded joints due to their debonding process. We propose to optimise the geometry of the adhesive assembly in order to increase the amount of energy dissipated due to the damage of the adhesive during the crash. The scope is to define the best geometrical configuration of the joint to dissipate the largest amount of energy with safety purposes. To this aim, we study the behaviour of a bonded joint of two composites submitted to impact loading by means of the Finite Element Method. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Improvement of the structural adhesive increases the difficulties in crash simulations of adhesive-bonded vehicle structures. In this paper, a simplified finite element model is recommended for modeling of the toughened adhesive-bonded joint. Solid elements and shell elements are respectively used to represent the adhesive and the base metal. To better predict the impact response of adhesive, an isotropic elastoplasticity model in LS-DYNA 971 is modified, in which the strain rate effect of both the pre-failure material properties and the failure criterion can be characterized. A method that can correct the variation of adhesive thickness is developed. The input failure parameters of the material model are identified with simulations of adhesive-bonded coach-peel and lap-shear coupon tests. It is found that adhesive failure parameters in the simplified model are independent of the base metal thickness. To improve the simplified model, several issues associated with its practical application, e.g., influence of spewed-out adhesives, variations of adhesive layer representation, have also been addressed in this paper. The recommended simplified model is then used in simulation of the adhesive-bonded tube axial impact test, which validates well its characterization capability and computational efficiency. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this article was the analysis of the damage and failure behaviour of the hybrid joint consisted of: three aluminium plates (adherents), the polyurethane adhesive (two laps 40 × 40 mm) and reinforced by five rivets. The ABAQUS programme was used to simulate the tensile strength in this type of joint. The 3D numerical analysis includes modelling of: the aluminium plates, the rivets and the cohesive layers. We used mass scaling and a half of the specimen model to increase the minimum time increment in the explicit analysis. The aluminium plates and the rivets were subjected to large plastic deformations, which were described by Huber-von Mises yield model with isotropic hardening. Modelling of damage process in the adhesive layers with a finite thickness was based on their cohesive behaviour with application of cohesive elements. A displacement - based damage parameter was introduced into the constitutive equation. Experiments carried out for three kinds of joints: the simple rivet joint, the simple adhesive bonded joint and the hybrid adhesive-riveted joint were confirmed by numerical results. Both the experimental tests and the computer simulations showed that the tensile strength of the hybrid joint was higher than the adhesive bonded joint or joint with the five rivets. Addition of the rivets to the adhesive bonded joint increases the energy absorption during the failure process in comparison to the riveted or the adhesive bonded joints. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics are indirectly used by equating, in the case of single-mode delamination, the area underneath the traction/relative displacement curve to the critical energy release rate of the mode under examination. For mixed-mode delamination an interaction model is used which can fulfil various fracture criteria proposed in the literature. It is then shown that the model can be recast in the framework of a more general damage mechanics theory. Numerical results are presented for the analyses of a double cantilever beam specimen and for a problem involving multiple delamination for which comparisons are made with experimental results. Issues related with the numerical solution of the non-linear problem of the delamination are discussed, such as the influence of the interface strength on the convergence properties and the final results, the optimal choice of the iterative matrix in the predictor and the number of integration points in the interface elements.

abstract={Nowadays, there are two fundamental issues in car body design. On the one hand, there is the need for weight reduction in order to reduce fuel consumption and, consequently, pollutant emissions, and on the other hand, there are ever more stringent safety requirements. To meet these targets, the trend is towards using hybrid structures made of unconventional materials, like aluminium, polymeric and composite materials. The use of these materials brings about some problems, one of them is associated with the joining techniques because the traditional resistance spot-welding, used in the assembly of a common steel chassis, cannot be used. Among the different alternative solutions, the most promising is the use of structural adhesives. From this perspective, this work aims to model the behaviour of simplified crash box elements made of different types of materials joined together by structural adhesives. In particular, the attention was focused on the adhesive joint modelling with a cohesive element formulation. Starting from experimental results for the characterization of the adhesive, the cohesive parameters were identified. The results were then applied to model the crushing of simplified crash boxes. The crushing axial compression of these components was investigated considering geometrical and loading conditions. The models were developed and verified by comparing the numerical with experimental results on these components. A good correlation was found in all loading conditions and with different geometries and substrate combinations. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={Modelling and testing of hybrid joints obtained by combination of two simple techniques, i.e., by application of spot welding and adhesive, is reported. The joints were subjected to uniaxial tension. The experiments were performed for: 1) a pure joining of the parts by spot welding and 2) spot welding-adhesive joining of the structural elements. A new experimental method was elaborated with application of two digital image correlation (DIC) systems. The method allowed for online monitoring of the deformation process of the joined elements with complex shapes. Modelling of the hybrid joints response to mechanical loading was performed by ABAQUS code. Damage process in the adhesive layer was taken into account. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that the strengthening of joints by the application of adhesive significantly improves static strength and energy absorption. The visible degradation process of the adhesive layer which started prior to the maximum value of force carrying the hybrid joint was obtained. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In recent years cohesive elements, coupled with a finite-element analysis (FEA) approach, have become increasingly popular for simulating both delamination in composite materials and fracture in adhesively-bonded joints. However, the industrial application of Cohesive Zone Models to model large and complex structures has been hindered by the requirement of extremely fine meshes along the crack propagation path. In the present work two-dimensional linear and quadratic (i.e. second-order) cohesive elements to model crack initiation and growth have been implemented in Abaqus using a user subroutine. These elements, which have a modified topology that allows a user-defined number of integration points, have been employed to model the fracture response of various mode I test specimens consisting of metallic substrates bonded with a structural film-adhesive. The effects of the mesh-density, element order and number of integration points on the numerical solution have been investigated. Whilst the linear models have shown the typical mesh-size dependent behaviour, the results obtained with their quadratic counterparts have been found to be independent of the element size. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing the number of integration points improves the stability, convergence and smoothness of the solutions. The mesh-size independent response obtained with the quadratic models arises from more accurate simulation of the deformed profile of the substrates and a more accurate calculation of the energy dissipated in the process zone due to damage. Overall, it is demonstrated that the quadratic cohesive-element formulation enables the use of much coarser meshes, resulting in shorter simulation times, and will therefore allow an increase in the industrial application of Cohesive Zone Models. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Dynamic fracture of an adhesive layer in a structure is analysed. The structure represents some specific properties of an automotive structure and is simple enough to allow for closed form solutions obtained by the method of characteristics. These solutions are compared to results of explicit FE-analyses. The FE-solutions agree with the closed form solutions. Damage is included in the FE-model. Three constitutive models of the adhesive layer are used. It is shown that an amplification of the strain rate is achieved in the adhesive layer. It is also shown that an artificially increased flexibility of the adhesive in an aluminium structure gives only minor influences of the general behaviour. In some load cases, the adhesive layer will experience repeated loading/unloading. It is shown that in these cases an explicit FE-analysis with a "large" time step is more prone to give immediate rupture. Thus, the method is conservative. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
