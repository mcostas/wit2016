\begin{abstract}
This work describes an investigation on the structural optimization of the crash response of aircraft or road vehicle crash boxes, where the force pulse due to frontal impact or hard landing wanted to be kept as stable as possible while reducing the mass of the energy absorbing systems.Â The objective functions were minimized in a multi-objective approach using metamodeling on FE models and genetic evolutionary algorithms. Finite element models were subjected to a frontal impact test against a simplified rigid wall in the case of the car model, or to hardlanding impact for the fuselage model. Force-time curves was obtained from the analysis and suitably filtered. The objective functions were calculated as the variance of this force-time curves and the total structural mass. The objective was to obtain a force-time curve which was as close as possible to the ideal dissipator curve, with lower values of the peaks of acceleration experienced by the occupants; and to minimize the mass for fuel saving and environmental reasons. To that end, optimization strategies were planned carefully to deal with problems which are typical in crashworthiness optimization like expensive computation times and numerical noise.

\section{Introduction}
Occupant safety is a key issue on vehicle and aircraft design nowadays, and crashworthy elements are required to absorb the energy during a crash and minimize the effects on the occupants. Aircraft and vehicles are nowadays provided with crash boxes to absorb the impact energy through deformation in order to protect the passengers. They are usually tube-shaped and made of several parts that require some kind of bonding.

On the other hand, structural adhesives have improved their mechanical properties in recent years and can be now used with confidence in heavy duty applications. Interest on them is also raising up in scientific fields thanks to these enhancements and to the recent development of validated numerical models.

As shown in \Cref{fig:comparison}, adhesives are very competitive both in bonding strength and in economical manufacturing costs \cite{superyacht}. In order to check adhesive's suitability for their use in crashworthy elements, this research develops numerical models of adhesively bonded crash boxes subjected to impact loads using finite element models. Information and data present in the literature are used to create and validate these models in order to ensure the accuracy of the results.

\section{Finite element model}
The modeled crash box consists of two adherend cold-formed sheets made of steel that create a tube of square section bonded together with an epoxy adhesive. The joint is practiced on the surface of two flanges on each adherend side. In order to ease the model validation, the crash box geometry was created to reflect those tested by \cite{Peroni2009} and later modeled by \cite{Scattina2011}. In particular, the two sections depicted in \cref{fig:crash_box} are modeled in the present study.

The tube is crushed between two rigid plates, one fixed and the other moving at impact speed (see \Cref{fig:general}). In order to ease the formation of a stable collapse mechanism, a triggering is machined near the front end of the tube. The trigger starts a desired collapse mode in that area. Due to the high slenderness of the tube, difficulties were found in order to achieve stable collapse mechanisms. On their place, tubes diverted from their axis. Trying to avoid these critical situations, four rigid plates on a rectangular section around the crash tube were added to the model as a bounding box. Its section was $\num{100}\times\SI{60}{\mm}$ and co-centered with the crash box.

The impact plate moved during the simulation at $\SI{10}{\m/\s}$ on a total distance equal to half of the total tube's length, resulting in a total analysis time of $\SI{0.015}{\s}$. Rotational degrees of freedom were fixed on the frontal plate. The rear plate had all degrees of freedom restrained.

The last $\SI{5}{\mm}$ of the crash tube had all degrees of freedom fixed (see \cref{fig:general}), except displacement on the impact direction in order to allow the reaction force measurement commented before. This way, numerical issues due to excesive unrestrained degrees of freedom on the whole tube were prevented.

Peeling problems were found near the impact head end during the development of the study. \cite{Peroni2009} solved this situation by adding two rivets on the bonded flanges at the triggered section in order to avoid excesive debonding on that part of the tube in the initial phases of the impact and, thus, prevent critical situations. In this study, this was simulated by a $\SI{2}{\mm}$-diameter spot-weld at the same location.

\subsection{Materials}

The model is made up of two different materials: the adherends of the tube are made of steel and the adhesive is the epoxy-based, heat-cured Loctite Hysol 9514.

According to \cite{manufCatalog}, the shear strength of the adhesive is $\SI{44}{\MPa}$, although this parameter is subject to variation depending both in cure temperature and time. The bulk modulus is $\SI{1460}{\MPa}$ and the adhesive's density is $\SI{1.30}{\tonne/\m^3}$ \cite{manufCatalog}. The constitutive behavior was supposed to be isotropic linear elastic \cite{SernaMoreno2015} up to failure start. An uncoupled traction elastic behavior \cite{Sadowski2010, Sadowski2011, Scattina2011, Sadowski2014} on 3D cohesive finite elements was chosen.

\cite{Scattina2011} obtained adhesive stiffnesses through the inverse method, which are summarized in \cref{tab:ads_params}. These same parameters were used in the present study, as their results could be validated with the model.

\end{table}

Contact failure modeling ---corresponding to adhesive failure--- resulted in some simulation problems, so adhesives and adherends were kept together with a simplified tie constraint. Thus, failure definitions were only included in the bulk material, obviating the contact/adhesive failure as suggested by several authors \cite{Greve2007, Loureiro2010, Sadowski2010, Sadowski2011, Scattina2011, Sadowski2014, SernaMoreno2015}, although the modeled cohesive damage parameters include the effect of both adhesive and cohesive resistance. The quadratic nominal stress criterion is a damage initiation criterion, defined as
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\left<\sigma_{n}\right>}{\sigma_{n}^{0}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\tau_{II}}{\tau_{II}^{0}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\tau_{III}}{\tau_{III}^{0}}\right)^{2} = 1 ;
\label{eq:quads}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{n}^{0}$, $\tau_{II}^{0}$ and $\tau_{III}^{0}$ represent the pure mode loading threshold stresses for each direction. The out-of-plane value, $\sigma_{n}^{0}$, was set to $\SI{42.5}{\MPa}$ \cite{Scattina2011}, which corresponds to the peeling failure stress for steel. Note that Macaulay brackets indicate that compression is not considered in failure initiation. Both in-plane values, $\tau_{II}^{0}$ and $\tau_{III}^{0}$, were set to $\SI{130}{\MPa}$ \cite{Scattina2011}. These values are also included in \cref{tab:ads_params}. % ref to catalog?

As long as the condition exposed in \cref{eq:quads} is not satisfied, the adhesive layer behaves elastically. Once the condition gets satisfied, damage starts and a degradation in stiffness can be appreciated following the specified damage evolution model. For this particular case, the material degradation was set as a fracture energy power law, as given by \cref{eq:fracture_energy}.

\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{G_{I}}{G_{Ic}}\right)^{\alpha}+\left(\frac{G_{II}}{G_{IIc}}\right)^{\alpha}+\left(\frac{G_{III}}{G_{IIIc}}\right)^{\alpha}=1 ;
\label{eq:fracture_energy}
\end{equation}
where $G_{Ic}$ corresponds to the critical fracture energy required to cause failure in mode I (out-of-plane direction), and being $G_{IIc}$ and $G_{IIIc}$ the values for mode II and III, respectively, which correspond to both shear directions. The critical fracture energy for the Loctite Hysol 9514 in the normal direction is $\SI{2028}{\J/\m^2}$ \cite{Scattina2011}. It was considered that the adhesive had no preferential directions for tangential failure, meaning $G_{IIc}$ was equal to $G_{IIIC}$, and being the fracture energy equal to $\SI{11853}{\J/\m^2}$ \cite{Scattina2011}. These values are also provided in \cref{tab:ads_params}. The exponent $\alpha$ was considered equal to $\num{2}$ \cite{Loureiro2010, Sadowski2010, SernaMoreno2015}.

Regarding the metal sheets, in order to make the model comparable to the experiments carried out by \cite{Peroni2009}, steel was chosen for these adherends. In the present study, it is defined as an isotropic elastic-plastic material, with a density of $\SI{7.85}{\tonne/\m^3}$.

The elastic part of the adherend stress-strain curve is defined as linear, with an elastic modulus of $\SI{200}{\GPa}$ and a Poisson ratio of $\num{0.3}$. An initial yield stress of $\SI{190}{\MPa}$ is set, and work hardening is defined through a tangent plastic modulus of $\SI{950}{\MPa}$ \cite{Peroni2009}.



\subsection{Finite element mesh and simulation setup}

The use of cohesive elements allowed to make the adhesive's mesh much coarser due to their aspect ratios requirements. These elements were created with a size of $\SI{2.0}{\mm}$, and had only one element in the $\SI{0.3}{\mm}$ layer thickness. Other tried element types, specifically solids, had problems if side lengths were bigger than about $\SI{0.5}{\mm}$, and were completely unfeasible with lengths larger than $\SI{1.0}{\mm}$ approximately.

% Tie (include image)
The tie constraint included in Abaqus enabled non-coherent meshes between adhesive and adherend (\cref{fig:mesh_detail_coh3d_comparison}). This way, finer meshes could be implemented on the adhesive in order to improve the representation of the failure progression without increasing the adherend element recount by leaving a coarser mesh there.

The finite element package Abaqus Explicit is used in this research, on is version 6.13 \cite{Abaqus613Manual} running on a high performance computing cluster. Jobs running on loop parallelization over $16$ cores took about $\SI{8}{\hour}$ to finish. Domain parallelization turned out to be inefficient in this case due to poor network performance.

\section{Optimization strategy}




\subsection{Surrogate-based methods}

In order to optimize the specimen, a surrogate-optimization approach is used. Therefore, the computationally-expensive  objective functions of the model are replaced by another functions less costly to evaluate. 

Firstly, with the parametrized model, a sampling of !!N!! samples is performed, relying on the LHS technique. This method creates a set of data with homogeneous projections on each variable axis, so that no superimposed projections appear. 

Once the sampling is obtained, the surrogate model is created. The Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) method is chosen, where the surrogate functions are adjusted with cubic splines following the next expression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mars}
\hat{f}\left ( \bm{x} \right )= \sum_{m=1}^{M}a_{m}B_{m}\left ( \bm{x} \right ),
\end{equation}
where $B_{m}$ are the power basis functions, $a_{m}$ the coefficients of the functions, and $M$ is the number of functions. This method is more thoroughly explained in \cite{Friedman1995197}. 

In order to judge the accuracy of the trend functions, the goodness of fit $R^2$, needs to be looked into. This indicator is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correlation_coefficient}
  R^2 = {\left(\dfrac{\sigma_{\bm{f}
\bm{\hat{f}}}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{\bm{f}}^2
\sigma_{\bm{\hat{f}}}^2}}\right)}^2
\end{equation}

This is done for all objective functions, where values equal or higher than $0.95$ for the selected objective functions are expected. 

With the surrogate-based model created, two optimization strategies are used. In a first approach, single-objective optimization techniques are applied. The calculations that this type of optimization requires are relatively simple once the proper surrogate model has been built. Single-objective optimization searches for the minima of the function within the limits of the design space. Traditional methods involving gradient-based and Hessian-based information are not very useful for optimizing the type of problems studied in this research, since many local minima are found in the function, yielding only misleading results. Therefore, a single-objective evolutionary algorithm is used, since this type of methods are slower but dodge local minima with ease.

The other type of optimization used is multi-objective optimization. This procedure involves more resources for the calculations. Instead of a single point, the results are conformed by a Pareto front, corresponding to a range of results. The set of all Pareto optimal design configurations, $P^*$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
P^* := \left\{ x \in \Pi \   \nexists x' \in \Pi \    \hat{f}_i \left( \bm{x'} \right) \leqslant \hat{f}_i \left( \bm{x} \right)  \right\}
\end{equation}
and the Pareto front, which is the set of optimal objective functions from the Pareto design configurations, $PF^*$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
PF^* := \left\{ \overline{\bm{u}} = \left( \hat{f}_1 \left( \bm{x} \right), \ldots , \hat{f}_k \left( \bm{x} \right) \right)  x \in P^* \right\}
\end{equation}

In the end, the set of points from the Pareto front has a number of components equal to the number of objective functions, each constituting a feasible solution to the problem. This Pareto front points cannot improve the value of one objective function without worsening the value of at least one other objective function. \Cref{fig:Pareto} shows an example of a Pareto front opposing the energy absorbed by the specimen and its mass, where the line constitutes the set of optima for these metrics.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{figures/IMG/Pareto}
  \caption{Pareto frontier opposing energy absorbed and mass of the specimen.}
  \label{fig:Pareto}
\end{figure}

Therefore, the results shall be analyzed and, depending on the needs required for the specimen, one or other point on the frontier is chosen. As with the single-objective optimization, multi-objective optimization usually has problems with local minima. For this problem, genetic algorithms are used, aiming for better and more reliable results.

The methods selected for both the single- and the multi-objective optimization are the genetic algorithms from the JEGA Library, developed by \cite{JEGA}. This methods perform optimization supporting general constraints as well as mixtures of real and discrete variables. The variables are encoded and referred to as chromosomes, and each digit of the variable is a gene.

\subsection{Metrics}
\todo{Plagiado}
The objective of this research is to find a set of optimum designs of the specimen previously described according to three different objective functions. These functions are the absorbed energy ($E_a$), the mass of the specimen ($m$) and the peak load ($P_{peak}$). The three metrics are obtained using a finite element simulation, where $E_a$ and $P_{peak}$ are obtained via the force-displacement curves.

Before making any calculations with the force-displacement curve, and according to the specialized literature in crash analysis \cite{Huanglibro}, a standard SAE 600 filter \cite{J211} is applied. This removes the high-frequency noise from the curve with a cutoff frequency of ${1000}$ Hz. Once the filter is used, the direct integration of the resulting force-displacement curve yields to the $E_a$:
\begin{equation}\label{Ea}
  E_{a}=\int _{0}^{\delta }F\! \left( z \right) \,dz\,,
\end{equation}
with $\delta$ being the total axial crushing distance and $F\! \left( z \right)$ the value of the crushing force at the crushing length $z$.

The peak load $P_{peak}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{Peak}
 P_{peak}=max\left\{ F\! \left( z \right)  \forall z \in [0,\delta] \right\}
\end{equation}

These three objective functions have not been randomly chosen. The first reason is the nature of the design and its aim to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles. The $E_a$ can be easily improved by increasing the thicknesses of the materials, but this would harm the other two objective functions $m$ and $P_{peak}$, increasing both of them. An increase in the mass of the specimen translates into a higher mass of the vehicle, increasing its fuel consumption and reducing its performance; whereas an increase in the $P_{peak}$ means a higher force and acceleration suffered by the passengers of the vehicle, raising the odds of resulting in a serious injury.

The second reason for choosing these objective functions is purely computational. Traditionally, other researchers have swerved towards optimization of the specific energy absorption (SEA) and the load ratio (LR) \cite{Hou2007555}. The SEA function is defined as a ratio between $E_a$ and $m$:
\begin{equation}\label{SEA}
  S\! EA=\dfrac {E_a} {m}
\end{equation}

By contrast, the load ratio relates the $P_{peak}$ with the mean load $P_m$ as
\begin{equation}\label{LR}
  LR=\dfrac {P_{peak}} {P_m}
\end{equation}

The mean load is obtained as a ratio between the absorbed energy and the total crushing length $\delta$:
\begin{equation}\label{Pm}
  P_{m}=\dfrac {E_a} {\delta}
\end{equation}

The SEA and LR were also evaluated as objective functions, but it was found that during the optimization process these quantities have a more complicated comportment and a noisier nature for this model. Consequently, they were only used during the parameter study and the single-objective optimization. They were discarded from the multi-objective  optimization process and are only used as indicators to compare different specimens.

The peak load is also used as a constraint in the single-objective optimization. This is done so that, in the real specimen, the required force to crumple the piece is never over a certain value, thus protecting the rest of the car's chassis and the occupants. In the multi-objective optimization this is not required nor used, since the final results consist of Pareto fronts, where the maximum peak load depends on the mass or energy absorption desired.

\subsection{Optimization process}

In order to optimize the model, the process has been divided into different stages. Firstly, a parameter study is performed. A simple sampling of the work space for each variable is carried out. With this, a general idea of the variables' behavior is obtained.

Secondly, single-objective optimization is run for the SEA objective function. Whereas an optimization of the mass and the absorbed energy would provide better results, this can be easier optimized, since the other option requires multi-objective optimization. Both unconstrained and constrained optimization procedures are considered, setting a limit for the peak load constraint in the latter.

Lastly, multi-objective unconstrained optimization is sought. All objective functions are minimized, and the points obtained as solution cannot be improved in a variable without harming, at least, another one. This last step is the most complete, giving more information of the behavior of the functions and the optimization process, but due to the greater complexity in the evaluation it is computed the last.

Starting from a baseline model, the optima greatly improve the performance of the model. \Cref{fig:opt_comparison} shows the section of both a baseline model and the single-objective optimum for a maximized SEA. \todo{Te falta el caption. El label ya se lo puse yo.}
